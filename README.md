# Data Structures

This repository contains **assignments, projects, and practice work** developed for the **Data Structures** course.  
It focuses on the implementation and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms, primarily using **C++**, with some complementary exercises in **Java**.

---

## Repository Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured collection of academic work related to **data structures and algorithmic problem solving**, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## Repository Structure

- `.qtcreator/`  
  Project files created using Qt Creator during early development stages.

- `.vscode/`  
  Visual Studio Code configuration files used for development and debugging.

- `CursoC++_Udemy/`  
  Supplementary C++ exercises focused on language fundamentals and control structures.

- `Examen1/`  
  Solutions and practice exercises related to the first course exam.

- `PrimerosPasosC++/`  
  Introductory C++ programs and basic syntax practice.

- `Proyecto1_CucharaCaliente/`  
  First major course project, applying data structures to a real-world–style problem.

- `Proyecto2_ArbolesBinarios/`  
  Second major project, focused on **binary trees**, fully documented and commented.

- `PruebasInicialesEclipse/`  
  Initial tests and experiments using the Eclipse IDE.

- `Tareas/`  
  Homework assignments and algorithm implementations, including sorting algorithms.

- `Trabajo en Clase/`
